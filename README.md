# The Conf Web3JS demo

## Running

Make sure you have your NodeJS stack working; give it a shot to the [official documentation](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API) and get your hands dirty!

You will also need to run [Parity](https://parity.io/parity.html) or [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) (choose whenever you like) so our app can interact with the blockchain

Now run:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:lucca65/thedapp.git
$ cd thedapp
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Now navigate to `localhost:8080` and test your solution

## Notes

- This project uses ES Script 2015+, so some browsers may not run it well, check your updates!
- We do a little of dirty coding to update some UI elements, but we do that so no external framework is involved. That way you have a purer reference
- The video of our presentation we can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTCzOxnJ5HI&feature=youtu.be)
- Special thanks to @esdrasedu!
